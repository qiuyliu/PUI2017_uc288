# HW11_uc288 - Time Series Clustering

## Assignment 1
For the data download, 1993 data is not available in the Census Bureau database. The FTP links took a long time to run and **Sam Ovenshine** shared in the WhatsApp group for everyone that the location has changed and I used the code snippet he shared.

**Baiyue** provided the information on how to read the Census data and how it should be loaded into the dataframe. Turning the data into a pivot table was also from **Baiyue**.

For the standardization of the time series, I refered back to the hint from HW10 and applied the sample code to the dataframe. I also did a quick check based on the instructions that the standard deviation should be 1 and the mean should be ~0.

For the clustering, **Baiyue**, **Te**, and I discussed how to do it and I got the code for elbow and silhouette score from the ADS lab. I shared the idea for plotting the clustering centers and the clustered time series. For plotting the map, saving the label to the dataframe was from **Baiyue**.

Plotting the cluster means for both algorithms was done individually to compare the results of the two and attempt an interpretation.

## Assignment 2: In class K-means Clustering
Finished this assignment on my own following the in-class lecture and code.
