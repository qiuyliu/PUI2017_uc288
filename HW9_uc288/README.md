## Review of classmates' plot
Worked on this alone as instructed.

Reviewed Yukun Wan (yw3447)'s and Gaurav Bhardwaj (gb1877)'s plots and created markdown files in my repo and their individual repos.

## Census Geospatial Analysis
Followed the skeleton notebook by Professor Bianco and consulted **Rachel Lim Xin Rong (rxl204)** on the spatial join done.

For the shapefile download, I followed the code from Professor Bianco and used a similar file checking as **Rachel Lim Xin Rong (rxl204)** by getting the 'shp' file in the directory and added additional checking to prevent redownload into PUIDATA.

Also followed the SFTP instructions from Professor Bianco to get the AFF data onto compute.

Extra Credit was completed alone while basing the spatial lag on the code from the lab example (https://gitlab.cusp.nyu.edu/cmp670/geospatial/blob/master/GeospatialAnalysis_CitiBike.ipynb). Computation for the "impact" was roughly based on the hint from Professor Bianco.
