# HW8_uc288 - Visualization

## Department of Sanitation Tonnage Data

Above shows three maps of New York City separated by Community District blocks with the colors depicting the percentage of waste collected in 2016. It is separated into Refuse Waste, Paper Waste and Metal-Glass-Plastic (MGP) Waste. The amount was classified using a quantile scheme break.

To calculate for the percentage, the amount of waste collected per category was divided by the total amount of waste collected for the community district.

It is interesting to see that compared to the rest of the city, Lower Manhattan has a relatively lower percentage of refuse waste and a higher percentage of paper and MGP waste.

Above shows the trend of the waste collected per borough (also in percentages).

It shows that the amount of refuse waste collected seems to decrease a little over the years with a slight increase in the paper and MGP waste. It is also interesting to see that the Bronx has more MGP waste than paper wherein in all other boroughs, there is more paper waste than MGP waste.

## HW8_uc288_review

There are 4 plots that [Unisse made](https://github.com/unissechua/PUI2017_uc288/blob/master/HW8_uc288/README.md).The first third plot is a map and the second one is bar plot to show the trend.

### CLARITY 
> is the plot easy to read? is it clear or confusing, are the quantities being visualized ambiguous?

**1. NYC Refuse Waste Collected in 2016 (percentage), NYC Paper Waste Collected in 2016 (percentage), NYC Metal, Glass, Plastic Waste Collected in 2016 (percentage)**

- Each map is easy to read and informative as for comparison (lower and higher as shown by the color gradation) between one commmunity district to other district in each map.
- One thing that might be confusing is the label showing the percentage, but not up to 100% because the percentage value is divided to the other map. I personaly think that the purpose of the gradation map is to make comparison whether a certain area is more or less than other area, and if it comes to percentage I would think that the map is talking about the percentage / share of a certain area to the whole area. So in this case, based on the plot title, I will think that it is talking about a percentage of certain community district about certain waste cartegory to the whole NYC ( percentage = no of waste category A in loc B / no of waste category A in the whole NYC) because people tend to see a map as one entities (it is dangerous if the reader only read one map and not with other map). I also suggest, beside the percentage based on location, it also can be better that the quantities divided by population or other normalization variable. 
- Legend has outline circle that has different color (I rather think it sky blue), and it might be distorting the color in the legend since the circle is quite small.
- The grey area is not explained in the legend. Eventhough I have assumption that there is no value in the grey area, well my assumption can be wrong also, it might be better that the grey area also explained in the legend.

**4. trend of the waste collected per borough (also in percentages)**
- At first I'm not sure what is the map because there is no title on it.
- The percentage of each waste category is clear. I can compare each category.
- There is no label in x tick for each bar, which I assume is the year, but I don't know the order whether from left to the right or otherwise.
- The label covers the Staten Island plot,so I can not see whether those bar reach the same peak or different peak.


### ESTHETIC
> beautiful is a subjective judgment: you should not judge the plot on the basis of whether you think it is "beautiful", but you should judge whether its esthetic is functional to what it is meant to communicate. Are the colors chosen appropriately? Are the graphical elements used appropriate to represent the quantities being visualized? Are the graphical choices allowing you to focus on the right elements or are they distracting you?

**1. NYC Refuse Waste Collected in 2016 (percentage), NYC Paper Waste Collected in 2016 (percentage), NYC Metal, Glass, Plastic Waste Collected in 2016 (percentage)**

- The color looks fine. It explained the comparison whether certaina area has higher or lower value.
- I check with color oracle, the only problem occured in Tritanopia color blindness which is very rare, because the lowest and second lowest value turn into light grey and white so the grey area (the NaN value) is distorting.

**4. trend of the waste collected per borough (also in percentages)**
- The color between each category can be distinguish well. 
- The gradation color make me think that it has higher value, but actually it is not, because it only compare the year (nominal value), and also it is not consistent with the color in the label. I would suggest to add label to explain the meaning of each color, or change the color as the same or difference as long as not gradation.

### HONESTY
> is the plot honestly reproducing the data or is it deforming it, perhaps to emphasize a point?

**1. NYC Refuse Waste Collected in 2016 (percentage), NYC Paper Waste Collected in 2016 (percentage), NYC Metal, Glass, Plastic Waste Collected in 2016 (percentage)**

- The plot is reproducing the data honestly as the label shows. 

**2. trend of the waste collected per borough (also in percentages)**
- The plot also is reproducing the data honestly as the y axis shows.
